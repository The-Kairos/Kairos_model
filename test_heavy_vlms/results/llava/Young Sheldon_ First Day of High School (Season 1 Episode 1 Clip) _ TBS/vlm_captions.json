They are carrying a backpack, suggesting they might be heading to or from class.\n\nIn the center, two students are engaged in a conversation. One of them is wearing a blue and yellow plaid shirt, while the other is in a black and white striped shirt. Their interaction suggests a friendly exchange.\n\nOn the right, another student is seen walking towards the camera. They are wearing a black and white striped shirt, and they appear to be in mid-stride, perhaps heading towards their next class or destination.\n\nThe background reveals a school building with a red brick facade, and a large tree stands nearby, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting.
