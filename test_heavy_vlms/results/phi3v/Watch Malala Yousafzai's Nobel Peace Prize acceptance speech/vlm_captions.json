The background in the second frame is plain and lacks the colorful details of the first, suggesting a more formal or serious setting. The overall video seems to juxtapose a lively, public event with a more solemn, possibly political or official occasion. | Speech: Dear brothers and sisters, I was named after the inspirational Malalai of Mewand, who is the Pashtun Joan of Arc. The word Malala means grief-stricken, sad, but in order to lend some happiness to it, my grandfather would always call me Malala, the happiest girl in the world.
