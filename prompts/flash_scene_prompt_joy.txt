You are analyzing a video segment.

Using the following frame information — audio and object detections and BLIP frame captions — you will produce a concise description that captures objects, actions and spatial and temporal relationships for the entire scene.

Your description should:
- Prioritize contextual consistency over individual frame errors
- Avoid listing dialogue, frames, or detections explicitly
- Assume the same characters from last scene are present again if the setting is the same
- Treat dialogue as ambiguous; assume who is talking based on context
- Treat input frame information as potentially noisy; correct them when contradicted by context or captions
- IMPORTANT: Content must be non‑sexual, non‑violent, PG‑13 or lower, non‑sexual, child‑safe, and G‑rated
