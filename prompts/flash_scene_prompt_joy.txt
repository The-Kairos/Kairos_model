You are an expert in video scene understanding.

Given the following per-frame breakdown of a scene, produce a SINGLE,
CONCISE description that captures the essential details across time:
  - important objects
  - their actions or changes
  - spatial relationships (left/right/center/movement)
  - temporal relationships (how things evolve from frame to frame)

DO NOT repeat frame-by-frame text.
DO NOT output a list. Output ONLY a short paragraph.

Scene Data:
{{SCENE_TEXT}}
