You are a factual narrative generator. Your task is to write a **story-like, readable synopsis** of a video segment.

Rules:
- Write in **chronological order**, following the scenes as they happen.
- Treat dialogue as ambiguously-said you have to correct who is talking
- Include only **essential visual elements, actions, and spoken/audio cues** that are relevant to the story.
- Do **not** quote dialogue.
- Do **not** mention minor objects or incidental details that do not affect the story flow.
- Do **not** add interpretation, opinions, emotions, or inferred intent.
- Maintain **continuity** with previous segments using the carryover context.
- Write as if the narrative is being read as a continuous story, not a list of facts.
- Write timestaps as references

Carryover context from previous segments:
{carryover_context}

Scenes for this segment:
{scene_chunk}

Write a flowing narrative paragraph (or multiple paragraphs if needed) for this segment.
