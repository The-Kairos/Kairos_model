### Report on the Scene Featuring Paul Lang's Discussion on Multisensory AI

The scenes take place in a professional and formal setting, likely a TED Talk or similar conference, where the central figure, Paul Lang, is introduced and engages in discussions about AI advancements and sensory technology. Here's a detailed summary organized chronologically:

---

**Introduction (00:00:00–00:00:15)**  
The scene begins with a man on a skateboard in front of a vivid red and yellow background featuring the word "tedit." This is followed by a red background displaying the name "Paul Lang," which appears to serve as an introduction to a key figure in the event. The audio starts with the speaker expressing enthusiasm for the upcoming discussion. The visuals transition to a large auditorium with an audience seated, and the scene establishes the presence of a stage featuring individuals in a structured seating arrangement. The speaker mentions "Ted" guidelines and changes allowing more conversational formats, hinting at a TED-style event.

**Paul Lang's Introduction and Initial Discussion (00:00:15–00:01:02)**  
Paul Lang is introduced as a distinguished computer scientist affiliated with Carnegie Mellon and MIT. The speaker uses a metaphor about strawberries to highlight human sensory experiences, transitioning into a reflective discussion about taste buds and artificial flavors. The metaphor questions how sensory experiences influenced by artificial flavors could alter perceptions of natural tastes like strawberries.

The discussion further reflects on society’s obsession with visuals, referencing social media and literature such as *Slaughterhouse-Five* and Madeleine L'Engle’s works, contrasting visual focus with other senses humans possess. Paul is described as a leader in sensory innovation and AI, with contributions aimed at enhancing human potential.

**Exploration of Multisensory AI (00:02:13–00:03:26)**  
Paul introduces himself and shares his passion for closing the gap between AI and human sensory capabilities. He emphasizes how current AI systems perceive a narrow slice of the world, such as text and images, but are far behind in replicating senses like touch, smell, and taste. Paul explains his group, "Multisensory Intelligence," which is dedicated to creating AI systems capable of interacting with the world in human-like ways.

One of the projects Paul mentions involves enabling AI to simulate the human sense of smell. He describes smell as a sensory modality capable of perceiving the past, detecting recent changes such as food aromas or room occupancy, and imagines a future where AI could send smells along with photos to bridge connections between people.

**Discussion on Academic Journey and Research (00:04:22–00:05:45)**  
Paul recounts his academic journey that began during the rise of deep learning in 2018. He reflects on indecision about pursuing research in different fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, or speech processing, ultimately choosing to explore human communication's multifaceted nature. He discusses the combination of natural language processing, facial visual processing, and analyzing tone and gesture as critical elements for understanding human behavior and advancing AI capabilities. Early work on multimodal AI models integrating vision, language, and behavior led to momentum that continues today.

**Sensory Research and Advancements in AI (00:06:56–00:11:11)**  
The conversation shifts to sensory AI possibilities. Paul reflects on sensory ranking, envisioning AI developments allowing entirely new senses beyond human evolution, such as perceiving Wi-Fi or heat. He discusses Moravec's paradox—how intuitive human actions like gripping are difficult for AI—and highlights progress in touch digitization through advanced sensors. He predicts sensory AI advancements, such as tactile sensing and the more distant development of smell and taste recognition.

Paul elaborates on "augmented intelligence," which could expand human experience, enabling AI-assisted memory and reasoning. He describes practical applications in fields like health monitoring, where AI could track data and externalize insights to improve human decision-making. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) emerge as another area for exploration, with potential integration into human brains to augment capabilities in the future.

---

**Interdisciplinary Research and MIT Media Lab’s Innovations (00:13:14–00:14:39)**  
Paul discusses the importance of recruiting diverse talents for his group, emphasizing collaborations across disciplines, including biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and technology, to tackle challenges like AI for smell. He praises MIT’s Media Lab for fostering interdisciplinary innovation and describes a project creating immersive multisensory experiences. In this exhibition, users could input favorite memories to experience them through visuals, smells, and tactile sensations, creating personalized engagements.

---

**Closing Remarks and Informal Moments (00:14:39–00:15:21)**  
Toward the end, Paul reflects on the challenges of seamlessly integrating AI advancements into human life, addressing important considerations like privacy and decision augmentation rather than override. In a lighter, candid moment, Paul mentions improvising questions due to a lack of phone signal, apologizing to the audience but receiving positive reactions to the spontaneity. The dialogue transitions to casual exchanges about sensory preferences, such as favorite smells, tastes, and haptic experiences, maintaining engagement and providing a human touch to the professional discourse.
