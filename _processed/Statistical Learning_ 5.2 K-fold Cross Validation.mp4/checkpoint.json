Validation, as we've seen, but done sort of like a K-part play.

As we'll talk about in more detail, the best choices for K in number of folds is usually about five or 10. Okay, so, and I'll explain, we'll talk about that in a few minutes about why those are good choices. But let's fix here K equals five. So I've taken the dataset, I've divided it random, the samples into five parts, again, of the size of both the same. The box looks a bit bigger, right? Okay, well that's my lack of drawing ability, but anyway, it's supposed to be the same, that's trying to switch the word validation in. So the box is supposed to be about the same size and observation, number of observations. But in this case, the first parts, the validation set, the other four are the training parts. So what we're gonna do, what cross-validation does, it forms this five parts. We're gonna train the model on the four training parts, put together as one big block, take the fitted model and then predict on the validation part and record the error. And then that's phase one. Phase two, we're gonna, the validation set will be part two, this block. All the other four parts will be the training set. We fit the model to the training set and then apply it to this validation part. And in the third stage, this is the validation piece, et cetera. So we have sort of, we have five stages, where each, in each stage, one part gets to play the role of validation set. We have the four parts of the training set.

So the yi hat is now just a fit on a full dataset. Hi is the diagonal of the hat matrix. So have a look in the book for details, but the hat matrix is the projection matrix that projects y onto the column space of x to give you the fit. This is something that can get computed easily when you fit your v-squares model. So go ahead, Robert. Yeah, we haven't emphasized it, but it's available. It's one of the things that's available when you fit your v-squares model. So the overall point of this is that to do a Liebland-Cross-Validation for these particular models, you don't actually have to leave anything out. You can do the fit on the overall dataset and then extract the information you need to get the cross-validation sum of squares. It's interesting because the hi tells you how much influence an observation has on its own fit. It's a number between zero and one. And so if an observation is very influential in its own fit, you can see it punishes the residual because it divides by a number that's small and it inflates the residual.

So when you take the average cross-validation is, you take the average of errors over the endfolds and in leave an out-crossed validation, the endfolds look very similar to each other because the training sets are almost the same.

This is mean square error for simulated data. True error curve. How do we get that? Well, it's simulated data. So we can get a very big test set and estimate the error exactly. Leave and out cross validation is the black broken line and the orange curve is 10 fold cross validation. So we can see what do we see? Well, here we see that test error curve is a little higher than the 10 fold and leave and out cross validation. The minimum is fairly close but the minimum of cross validation is around 8 whereas the true curve is minimized around 6. In this case the two cross validation methods are doing a better job of approximating the test error curve and have the minimum, well, the minimum is fairly close, not exactly on the mark. Black curve is minimized around 6 and the true error curve is minimized around 3. Although those error curves are fairly flat. So there's obviously a high variance in where the minimum should be. Right. And that doesn't really matter. That's right. It's not going to matter much if you choose a model with flexibility 2 or maybe even 10 here because the error is pretty flat in that region.

Okay, so in the, we talked about cross-validation for a quantitative response, we use mean-square error, for classification problems, that he is exactly the same. The only thing that changes is the measure of error, of course, you no longer use square error, but on this classification error. Otherwise, cross-validation process is exactly the same. Divide the data up into k parts. We train on k minus 1 parts. We record the error on the kth part, and we add things up together to get the overall cross-validation error. It looks like a weighted average in that formula. It was nk over n. Well, do you want to explain that? Because each of the folds might not be exactly the same size. So we actually compute a weight which is proportioned to this, which is the relative size of the fold, and then use a weighted average. Right, and we are lucky that the k divides, the n divides by k, exactly the weight of this one, one over k. One other thing to add, which is that since this cross-validation error is just an average, the standard error of that average also gives us a standard error of the cross-validation estimate. So we take the error rates from each of the folds. The average is the cross-validation error rate. The standard error is the standard deviation of the cross-validation estimate. So here is the formula for that. So this is a useful quantity. And when we draw a CV curve, we should always put a standard error band around the curve to get rid of the variability. So in these previous pictures, we should have had a standard error band around the curves to give us an idea of how variable they are. I say here it's a useful lesson, but not quite valid. Why is that? Dr. Heastie? Well, I wonder why. Well, the thing is we compute in the standard errors if these were independent observations, but they're not strictly independent. Error sub k overlaps with error sub j because they share some training samples. So there's some correlation between that. But we use this anyway. We use it and it's actually quite a good estimate and people have shown this mathematically. Again, a point being that is that the cross-validation separates the training part of it from the validation part. When we talk about the bootstrap method, the next part of this section, we'll see that that's not the case and that's going to cause a problem. So cross-validation explicitly separates the training set from the validation set in order to get a good idea of test error. Okay, so this again, I want to re-emphasize that cross-validation is a very important technique to understand both for quantitative response and cross-validation classification.",

            "narrative": "### Chronological Summary of Educational Video on Cross-Validation Techniques\n\nThe video begins with the introduction of cross-validation as part of an ongoing educational series on statistical methods. The presenter, \"person #1,\" a man in a white shirt positioned in the bottom-right corner of the frame, sets the stage by stating, \"Welcome back. In the last section, we talked about validation and saw some drawbacks with that method.\" Cross-validation and its specific techniques are introduced as solutions to tackle these challenges.\n\nAt 00:00:06.000, the presenter transitions into the concept of \"K-fold cross-validation.\" He describes it as flexible and powerful for estimating prediction error and model complexity, illustrating this via a hypothetical division of the dataset into K parts. Each part sequentially takes on the role of the validation set while the rest serve as the training set. There is an emphasis on using visual aids as the presenter states, \"Let me go to the picture here,\" signaling the intention to refer to supporting diagrams.\n\nBy 00:00:54.667, K-fold cross-validation is demonstrated more concretely with an example where K=5. The presenter explains that the dataset is split into five equal parts, which serve alternately as validation and training sets. Errors are recorded at each stage, with their sum being defined as the \"cross-validation error.\" Visual aids are referenced, with the presenter noting, \"The box looks a bit bigger,\" while acknowledging imperfections in his drawing.\n\nAt 00:02:30.933, \"The details\" of K-fold cross-validation are formally introduced. Using notation, the folds are labeled as c1 through ck, each holding approximately equal observations. The presenter explains mean square error calculations for each fold, stating, \"We fit to the k minus one parts that don't involve part number k,\" iteratively capturing prediction errors. A special variation, called \"Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation\" (LOOCV), is discussed as an extreme case where each observation becomes a lone validation point, with the rest forming the training set.\n\nAt 00:04:05.867, LOOCV's application to least-squares and polynomial models is elaborated. The presenter explains its computational efficiency due to the \"hat matrix,\" describing it as \"the projection matrix that projects y onto the column space of x.\" He adds, \"Hi is the diagonal of the hat matrix... a number between zero and one,\" teaching how the matrix helps estimate cross-validation sums without numerous model refits.\n\nAround 00:05:47.067, attention shifts to evaluating the bias-variance tradeoff in cross-validation. The presenter explains why K=5 or 10 is preferred over LOOCV. He argues that training sets in LOOCV are almost identical, differing by only one observation, which increases error variance. Conversely, larger K values strike a balance between bias (caused by small training sets) and variance. Detailed comparisons between K-fold and LOOCV highlight their practical implications.\n\nAt 00:06:59.067, visual data comparisons from the textbook are introduced. The presenter contrasts validation outcomes between LOOCV and 10-fold cross-validation, emphasizing reduced variability and smooth curves with the latter. By averaging results, the presenter states, \"It gives us the overall estimate of cross-validation,\" an important consideration for practical applications. A segment reviews error estimation curves within figures, noting their effectiveness in approximating true test-error curves. For example, in one case, while cross-validation finds the error minimum around 8, the true test-error minimum is at 6, showing minor discrepancies but overall consistency.\n\nAt 00:08:08.533, the discussion pivots to statistical implications. The presenter reaffirms the importance of balancing bias and variance when selecting K, favoring values of 5 or 10 for general use. He further explains that cross-validation estimate variability is captured by error bands in the \"cross-validation curve.\" Despite theoretical limitations in error independence, he reassures viewers that the approach remains robust in practice, stating, \"People have shown this mathematically.\"\n\nFinally, by 00:10:51.200, the explanation bridges into topics like weighted averages and standard error calculations. The presenter notes that standard errors can be included in cross-validation curves to better visualize variability. He finishes by contrasting the separation between training and validation sets in cross-validation with alternative methods like the bootstrap, hinting that future sections will expand on these methodologies.\n\nOverall, the video thoroughly discusses cross-validation, emphasizing K-fold's advantages, LOOCV's special cases, and the practical balance of bias and variance, using visual aids and technical examples to engage viewers."
