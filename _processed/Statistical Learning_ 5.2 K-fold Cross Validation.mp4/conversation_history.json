    "rag_answer": "Based on the information provided, cross-validation (CV) techniques are described as follows:\n\nCross-validation is a very important technique used in statistical analysis for estimating prediction error and getting an idea of model complexity. The general process involves separating the training part of the data from the validation part to get a good idea of the test error.\n\nThe video details these specific CV techniques:\n\n*   **K-fold cross-validation:** This is a flexible and powerful method where the dataset is randomly divided into K parts (or \"folds\"). Each of the K parts takes a turn playing the role of the validation set, while the other K-1 parts are used as the training set to fit a model. The prediction error is recorded on the validation part. This is done for all K parts, and the errors are added or averaged to get the overall cross-validation error. The video mentions that common choices for K are 5 or 10.\n*   **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV):** This is a special case of K-fold cross-validation where the number of folds (K) is equal to the number of observations in the dataset. For certain models, like least-squares or polynomial models, this has a special computational formula that allows for calculating the error without having to refit the model for each fold.",

        "From 00:10:51.200 to 00:13:33.200, The current scene is part of an educational video on statistical methods, continuing a detailed discussion on cross-validation techniques. The frame shows a calculation problem, likely a visual aid to support the explanation. The audio features the presenter (\"person #1\") elaborating on the process of K-fold cross-validation, emphasizing the calculation of cross-validation error and its standard error. The presenter explains the importance of using weighted averages for folds of varying sizes and highlights the need to account for variability by including standard error bands in cross-validation curves. A key point discussed is the assumption of independence in error calculations, which is not strictly valid due to overlapping training samples, though the method remains effective in practice. The presenter transitions to a mention of the bootstrap method, hinting at upcoming topics. This scene builds on prior discussions of cross-validation, reinforcing its importance in error estimation and model evaluation.. Visible objects include none. Background audio: silence (conf=0.48). Spoken dialogue:  trade-off. Okay, so in the, we talked about cross-validation for a quantitative response, we use mean-square error, for classification problems, that he is exactly the same. The only thing that changes is the measure of error, of course, you no longer use square error, but on this classification error. Otherwise, cross-validation process is exactly the same. Divide the data up into k parts. We train on k minus 1 parts. We record the error on the kth part, and we add things up together to get the overall cross-validation error. It looks like a weighted average in that formula. It was nk over n. Well, do you want to explain that? Because each of the folds might not be exactly the same size. So we actually compute a weight which is proportioned to this, which is the relative size of the fold, and then use a weighted average. Right, and we are lucky that the k divides, the n divides by k, exactly the weight of this one, one over k. One other thing to add, which is that since this cross-validation error is just an average, the standard error of that average also gives us a standard error of the cross-validation estimate. So we take the error rates from each of the folds. The average is the cross-validation error rate. The standard error is the standard deviation of the cross-validation estimate. So here is the formula for that. So this is a useful quantity. And when we draw a CV curve, we should always put a standard error band around the curve to get rid of the variability. So in these previous pictures, we should have had a standard error band around the curves to give us an idea of how variable they are. I say here it's a useful lesson, but not quite valid. Why is that? Dr. Heastie? Well, I wonder why. Well, the thing is we compute in the standard errors if these were independent observations, but they're not strictly independent. Error sub k overlaps with error sub j because they share some training samples. So there's some correlation between that. But we use this anyway. We use it and it's actually quite a good estimate and people have shown this mathematically. Again, a point being that is that the cross-validation separates the training part of it from the validation part. When we talk about the bootstrap method, the next part of this section, we'll see that that's not the case and that's going to cause a problem. So cross-validation explicitly separates the training set from the validation set in order to get a good idea of test error. Okay, so this again, I want to re-emphasize that cross-validation is a very important technique to understand both for quantitative response and cross-validation classification.."

The frame shows text with a background image of an object, though the specifics of the object are unclear. The audio features a technical explanation of \"Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation\" (referred to as \"Liebland-Cross-Validation\"), focusing on its application to least-squares and polynomial models. The presenter, likely \"person #1,\" explains how this method allows for fitting the model on the full dataset without leaving out observations, using the hat matrix to calculate cross-validation sums of squares. The explanation emphasizes the influence of individual observations on their own fit, with the presenter stating, \"Hi is the diagonal of the hat matrix... it's a number between zero and one.\" This scene builds on prior discussions of cross-validation methods, providing further technical details and referencing a book for additional information.. Visible objects include none. Background audio: silence (conf=0.63). Spoken dialogue:  Now, actually, the Liebland-Cross-Validation has a special case of that. It represents a special case in the sense that this cross-validation can be done with what actually happened to refit the model at all. So Liebland-Cross-Validation, at least for a v-squares model or a polynomial model, if the cross-validation, Liebland-Cross-Validation has the following form. So the yi hat is now just a fit on a full dataset. Hi is the diagonal of the hat matrix. So have a look in the book for details, but the hat matrix is the projection matrix that projects y onto the column space of x to give you the fit. This is something that can get computed easily when you fit your v-squares model. So go ahead, Robert. Yeah, we haven't emphasized it, but it's available. It's one of the things that's available when you fit your v-squares model. So the overall point of this is that to do a Liebland-Cross-Validation for these particular models, you don't actually have to leave anything out. You can do the fit on the overall dataset and then extract the information you need to get the cross-validation sum of squares. It's interesting because the hi tells you how much influence an observation has on its own fit. It's a number between zero and one. And so if an observation is very influential in its own fit, you can see it punishes the residual because it divides by a number that's small and it inflates the residual. So it sort of does the right thing here. Okay, so, but...."

It's extremely flexible and powerful technique for estimating prediction error and to give an idea of model complexity. So what's the idea of K-fold cross-validation? Well, it's really in the name. Validation, as we've seen, but done sort of like a K-part play. It's done K times with each part, again, to play the role of the validation set, and the other K-parts playing the role of the training set. So I say here, let me go to the picture here.."

The frame displays a computer screen showing the results of two different simulations, accompanied by detailed audio commentary from the presenter (\"person #1\"). The presenter explains the comparison between true error curves and cross-validation methods (Leave-One-Out and 10-Fold), highlighting their effectiveness in approximating test error curves. Key observations include the flatness of error curves in certain regions and the proximity of minimum error values across methods. The discussion references figures from a textbook (e.g., Figures 5.6 and 2.9) and emphasizes the practical implications of model flexibility and error estimation. This scene builds on prior discussions of cross-validation techniques, providing deeper insights into statistical modeling and error analysis.. Visible objects include none. Background audio: none. Spoken dialogue:  Okay, this is figure 5.6 from the textbook and this is the simulated data example which was figured from figure 2.9 of the book. Just recall this is smoothing splines in three different situations. In this case the true curve, true error curve is the blue curve. Again, these three different functions that we're examining. This is mean square error for simulated data. True error curve. How do we get that? Well, it's simulated data. So we can get a very big test set and estimate the error exactly. Leave and out cross validation is the black broken line and the orange curve is 10 fold cross validation. So we can see what do we see? Well, here we see that test error curve is a little higher than the 10 fold and leave and out cross validation. The minimum is fairly close but the minimum of cross validation is around 8 whereas the true curve is minimized around 6. In this case the two cross validation methods are doing a better job of approximating the test error curve and have the minimum, well, the minimum is fairly close, not exactly on the mark. Black curve is minimized around 6 and the true error curve is minimized around 3. Although those error curves are fairly flat. So there's obviously a high variance in where the minimum should be. Right. And that doesn't really matter. That's right. It's not going to matter much if you choose a model with flexibility 2 or maybe even 10 here because the error is pretty flat in that region. And then the third example, the two cross validation curves do quite a good job of approximating the test error curve and the minimum is around 10 in each case. That's it.."

Now let's see what happens with even out cross validation, we get a curve that's, again got the minimum around the same place as we saw before, and then it's pretty flat after that. 10 fold cross validation, now again it's also showing the minimum around two, but it's, there's not the, what we're seeing here is the 10 fold cross validation as we take different partitions into 10 parts of the data, and we see there's not much variability, they're pretty consistent. In contrast to the, we divide into two parts, we've got much more variability. Those get averaged as well, those curves in the right. So, yeah, they're averaged together.."

Spoken dialogue:  and I'll sort of point the picture as I say it. So here we're doing five full cross-validation. As we'll talk about in more detail, the best choices for K in number of folds is usually about five or 10. Okay, so, and I'll explain, we'll talk about that in a few minutes about why those are good choices. But let's fix here K equals five. So I've taken the dataset, I've divided it random, the samples into five parts, again, of the size of both the same. The box looks a bit bigger, right? Okay, well that's my lack of drawing ability, but anyway, it's supposed to be the same, that's trying to switch the word validation in. So the box is supposed to be about the same size and observation, number of observations. But in this case, the first parts, the validation set, the other four are the training parts. So what we're gonna do, what cross-validation does, it forms this five parts. We're gonna train the model on the four training parts, put together as one big block, take the fitted model and then predict on the validation part and record the error. And then that's phase one. Phase two, we're gonna, the validation set will be part two, this block. All the other four parts will be the training set. We fit the model to the training set and then apply it to this validation part. And in the third stage, this is the validation piece, et cetera. So we have sort of, we have five stages, where each, in each stage, one part gets to play the role of validation set. We have the four parts of the training set. We take all the prediction errors from all five parts, we add them together and that gives us what's called the cross-validation error.."

And we'll try to make the number of observations about the same in every part. Of course, if n is not a multiple of k of five, we can't do that exactly, but we'll do it approximately. So we'll let n sub k be the number of observations in the kth part. So here's the cross-validation error rate. Basically, this is the mean square error we get by applying the... We fit to the k minus one parts that don't involve part number k. That gives us our fit yi hat for observation i. It's four-fifths of the data in this case. And then we add up the error.
