### Detailed Chronological Report of the Cooking Tutorial

The cooking tutorial begins at **00:00:00.000** with the narrator introducing a recipe for homemade pasta dough, emphasizing its simplicity. A cutting board with pasta is prominently displayed, and a stationary decorative item labeled as "donut #1" is visible. The narrator states, "Today I'm showing you all how to make a simple recipe for a basic homemade pasta dough."

Between **00:00:06.500** and **00:00:18.167**, the tutorial demonstrates the initial stages of preparing pasta dough. The narrator acknowledges that the recipe is not luxurious but highlights its ease, reassuring viewers, "If the pasta aisle at your grocery store is empty, don't panic." The video focuses on accessibility, showing a bowl of food (tracked as "bowl #2"), cutting pasta, and hygiene tips, such as washing hands and sanitizing work surfaces.

At **00:00:26.667**, the video transitions back to measuring ingredients for the dough. A measuring cup appears as flour is poured, and the narrator mentions, "Then you'll need two cups of flour." Subsequent scenes depict the step-by-step process of creating the dough, including mixing flour, cracking eggs ("Dump the flour onto your clean work surface... Then crack in three eggs"), and optionally adding olive oil and salt to achieve the right consistency.

From **00:01:00.167** to **00:01:36.833**, the tutorial guides viewers through kneading the dough, stating, "Begin to slowly incorporate the flour from around the sides of the well," followed by tips for troubleshooting consistency: "If it's too dry... add a touch of water. If it's too wet, add a little bit more flour." The narrator emphasizes patience and technique, instructing viewers to knead for about ten minutes.

At **00:01:53.500**, the tutorial shifts briefly to woodworking but quickly returns to rolling the dough for pasta. The narrator explains shaping preferences, stating, "The dough will go from looking shaggy and rough to smooth and taut... you'll know it's done when it springs back."

Between **00:02:04.000** and **00:02:14.833**, the tutorial further details the process, including rolling dough into manageable portions and cutting it into specific shapes such as tagliatelle. Additional tips include lightly flouring the surface to prevent sticking and letting gluten relax if the dough shrinks. At **00:02:29.333**, the narrator introduces the folding technique for dough: "Fold it in thirds like this, then roll it out."

From **00:02:40.833** onwards, the focus shifts to preparing the dough for storage and cooking. The narrator advises, "Wrap it and freeze it or refrigerate it," before transitioning to guidance on cooking freshly prepared pasta.

At **00:03:56.833**, the tutorial outlines cooking specifics: "Fresh pasta cooks quickly and will probably only need about 2–3 minutes in salted boiling water." The visuals emphasize the final preparation, showing pasta on a stove and garnishes like arugula and parmesan cheese. The narrator shares presentation tips, such as drizzling olive oil over the finished dish, accompanied by tomato sauce.

Concluding remarks begin at **00:04:42.667**, where the narrator encourages viewers to subscribe and promises more pasta-related content, stating, "I'll probably be posting pasta videos every day this week. If you like this video... consider subscribing." At **00:04:50.167**, the narrator invites interaction through Instagram and comments, saying, "Reach out to me there, or leave questions in the comment section below."

The final moments between **00:05:03.833** and **00:05:21.833** shift to a more conversational tone. The narrator shares plans to experiment with saved pasta dough while answering viewer questions in future videos. The tutorial concludes on a pleasant note with faint music and the sound of children saying, "We'll see you tomorrow," signaling the end of the instructional series.
