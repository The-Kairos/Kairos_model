Dear brothers and sisters, I was named after the inspirational Malalai of Mewand, who is the Pashtun Joan of Arc. The word Malala means grief-stricken, sad. But in order to lend some happiness to it, my grandfather would always call me Malala, the happiest girl in the world. And today, I am very happy that we are together fighting for an important cause.
